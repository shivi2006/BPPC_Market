The hostel field is a choice field with following options:

    ("SR", "SR Bhavan"),

    ("GN", "Gandhi Bhavan"),
    
    ("KR", "Krishna Bhavan"),
    
    ("MR", "Meera Bhavan"),

I could have thought of just few, you are welcome to add more.

The product model has a category field which is also a choice field with following options:

    ("STAT", "Stationay"),
    
    ("MOVI", "Movie Ticket"),
    
    ("GRUB", "Grub Ticket"),
    
    ("ELEC", "Electronics"),
    
    ("CLOT", "Clothing"),
    
    ("OTHR", "Other Utility"),

## Getting and using an Auth Token

To access the API endpoints, you will need an Auth token. Do the following to get one:

1. Go to (Google OAuth Playground)[https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/].

2. In the first step, select Google OAuth2, select both user.email and user.profile. Login using BITS Mail when asked.

3. You will get a bunch of JSON data on the right side, copy the id_token from there.

4. Using this id_token, send a GET request to /auth/register endpoint.

```
curl --location --request POST '127.0.0.1:8000/auth/register/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "id_token": <YOUR ID_TOKEN>
}'
```
5. You will get a JSON response that is similar to this:

```
 {
  "token": <token>,
  "username": <username>,
  "email": <email>
  }
  
```

5. Copy the value of the token field and save it somewhere.

6. Use this token in the Authorization header in all further requests.

```
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "JWT eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0LCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImYyMDE5MDEyMCIsImV4cCI6MTU4NTI2Mjg4NCwiZW1haWwiOiJmMjAxOTAxMjBAcGlsYW5pLmJpdHMtcGlsYW5pLmFjLmluIn0.7WdcaO6mvlNEoFAz4ds7nvOWXLKJ5crDv3aPoj0F_YQ");

var requestOptions = {
 method: 'GET',
 headers: myHeaders,
 redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("127.0.0.1:8000/api/get_listings", requestOptions)
 .then(response => response.text())
 .then(result => console.log(result))
 .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
 
 ```
 
 If you are not very familiar with terminal then you can alterenatively use Postman to generate authorization tokens and to test end- points.
 
 ## API (End-Points)
 
 1. To get product list: ```GET /api/get_products/```
 
 2. To add product: ```POST /api/add_products/```
 
 3. To get details of a particular product: ```GET /api/get_product_detail/id/

 5. To search for a product by category or by description: ```GET /api/interested_buyers?category=<"Entered by user">&description=<"Entered by user">```
 
 The search category choices have been defined in Model Structure.

Whereas for string in description option it will go through the description of product as mentioned by the seller.
If both (category & description) are entered then the server will send only the products in that particular category with the mentioned keywords in description whereas in both the other cases search will be performed on whole product list with just the mentioned query parameter. 

6. To render list of all the interested buyers: ```GET /api/interested_buyers/id/ ```

7. To render list of all the products listed by a particular user: ```GET /api/get_user_products/id/```

Here id is the id of the seller.

8. To see your own profile: ```GET /api/my_profile/```

9. To Update your profile: ```POST /api/my_profile/update_profile/```

10. To Mark the product as Sold: ```GET /api/get_user_products/id/```

This option will only be present with seller of the product.
